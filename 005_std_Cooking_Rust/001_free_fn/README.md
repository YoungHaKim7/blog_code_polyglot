# Free Functions vs. Associated Functions (Methods)

|Feature| 	Free Function	|Associated Function (Method)|
|-|-|-|
|Definition	|Defined at the module level, not within an `impl` block.|	Defined within an impl block for a struct or a trait.|
|Calling Syntax|	`function_name(args)` or `module::function_name(args)`. |	`instance.method_name(args)` or `Struct::method_name(args)` (if it doesn't take `&self`, `&mut self`, or `self`).|
|`self` Parameter| Does not take `&self`, `&mut self`, or `self` as a parameter.|	Takes `&self`, `&mut self`, or `self` to operate on an instance of the struct.|
|Use Case|	Often used for static utility functions, operations where no single data "owner" is clear, or generic functions.|	Used when the function's logic is tightly coupled to a specific data structure.|
